<current_state>
Planning Phase 28 has NOT started yet. The user ran `/gsd:plan-phase` with this description:
"Ensure we infer SMT for: memory operations (array indexing and foreach, ranges and spans, member referencing), conditional operators (if, switch, pattern matching), typecasts (safe and unsafe, polymorphic operations), generics, and whatever else is missing."

Phase 28 does not exist in ROADMAP.md yet. v0.5 milestone has not been started. REQUIREMENTS.md was deleted after v0.4 completion.

Milestone v0.4 was just completed and archived (2026-02-23). Tag v0.4 pushed.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- v0.4 milestone: ALL DONE — 16/16 requirements, 27 phases, all archived
- Phase 27 (async CEX IDE fidelity): DONE — poll_iteration+await_side wired, pushed
- ROADMAP.md: collapsed to details sections, all 4 milestones shown as shipped
- PROJECT.md: v0.4 requirements moved to Validated, key decisions added
- REQUIREMENTS.md: deleted (archived to milestones/v0.4-REQUIREMENTS.md)
- Git tag v0.4: created and pushed
- .planning/milestones/: v0.4-ROADMAP.md, v0.4-REQUIREMENTS.md, v0.4-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md archived

NEXT: Plan Phase 28 — SMT VCGen Completeness

Steps needed:
1. Add Phase 28 to ROADMAP.md (🚧 v0.5 section)
2. Create fresh .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md for v0.5
3. Create phase directory .planning/phases/28-smt-vcgen-completeness/
4. Spawn gsd-phase-researcher to research what Rust constructs lack SMT coverage
5. Spawn gsd-planner to create 28-01-PLAN.md
6. Spawn gsd-plan-checker to verify

User's requested scope for Phase 28:
- Memory operations: array indexing (a[i]), foreach iteration, ranges (1..10, 1..=10), spans (&[T]), member field access
- Conditional operators: if/else, match (pattern matching), if-let, while-let
- Typecasts: numeric as-casts with truncation, unsafe transmute, polymorphic dispatch
- Generics: where-clause constraints in specs, generic spec propagation
- "What else is missing?" — researcher should determine this
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- v0.4 complete, v0.5 planning starting
- Phase 28 is first phase of v0.5 milestone
- Phase 28 goal: "VCGen completeness — all major Rust expression categories generate correct SMT VCs"
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- REQUIREMENTS.md does not exist (was deleted for fresh v0.5 start) — need to create before planning
- Phase 28 not yet in ROADMAP.md — need to add it
- Context exhausted before planning could start
</blockers>

<context>
The work session completed v0.4 milestone archival and was starting Phase 28 planning when context ran out. The next session needs to:
1. Create v0.5 REQUIREMENTS.md with SMT coverage requirements
2. Add Phase 28 to ROADMAP.md under a new v0.5 milestone section  
3. Run /gsd:plan-phase 28 with the user's scope
</context>

<next_action>
Run: /gsd:plan-phase 28

OR manually:
1. Edit .planning/ROADMAP.md — add "🚧 v0.5 SMT Completeness" milestone entry and Phase 28 details
2. Create .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md with v0.5 requirements (SMT coverage for array, match, casts, generics)
3. mkdir -p .planning/phases/28-smt-vcgen-completeness
4. Spawn gsd-phase-researcher for Phase 28
5. Spawn gsd-planner for Phase 28
</next_action>
