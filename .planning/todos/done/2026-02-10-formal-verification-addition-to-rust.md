title: Formal verification addition to Rust
area: general
files: []
---

## Problem

This project aims to add formal verification capabilities to the Rust programming language. The goal is to enable developers to mathematically prove properties about their Rust code, extending Rust's already strong safety guarantees with formal verification.

Context established:
- Project initialized with README.md and CLAUDE.md
- Git repository created with main branch
- Git flow initialized and enforced
- GitHub repository created at https://github.com/o2alexanderfedin/rust-fv
- Development toolchain: Rust
- No specific questions needed at this stage per user request

## Solution

TBD - Research and planning phase needed to determine:
- Formal verification approach (SMT solvers, proof assistants, etc.)
- Integration points with Rust compiler/toolchain
- Verification specification language/syntax
- Proof automation strategies
- Test suite and validation approach
