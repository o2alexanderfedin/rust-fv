**Audited:** 2026-02-27T00:00:00Z
**Previous audit:** 2026-02-26T07:30:00Z (status: gaps_found — 4 critical gaps)
**Phases in scope:** 37 (phases 01–32 + phase 00 UAT)
**Milestones covered:** v0.1 POC, v0.2 Advanced Verification, v0.3 Production Usability, v0.4 Full Rust Verification, v0.5 SMT Completeness + UAT, Gap Closure (phases 30–32)

## Executive Summary

**Status: passed**

All 13 tracked formal requirements are now **fully satisfied** (up from 11 satisfied, 2 partial in the previous audit). All 37 phases are formally verified with VERIFICATION.md (up from 27/34 verified). Cross-phase integration is confirmed intact across 9 E2E flows and all key wiring points. The 4 critical gaps identified in the 2026-02-26 audit have all been closed by Phases 30, 31, and 32.

All 5 tech debt items resolved by Phase 33 (v0.1 Tech Debt Resolution). Milestone archived.

**Live test suite:** 3,154 tests pass, 0 failures, 0 unexpected ignores (workspace-wide as of 2026-02-27)

## Gap Closure Summary (Previous Audit → This Audit)

| Gap (2026-02-26) | Resolution | Phase |
|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| Z3 bv2int "unknown constant" — 2 E2E tests commented out | **CLOSED** — `uses_spec_int_types()` now triggers `(set-logic ALL)` enabling bv2int | Phase 31 |
| Ghost locals filtering incomplete (vcgen.rs line 586) | **CLOSED** — `is_ghost_place()` guard in `encode_assignment()` + `collect_declarations()` | Phase 31 |
| SetDiscriminant VC deferred — vcgen_06_set_discriminant_assertion #[ignore]d | **CLOSED** — `generate_set_discriminant_vcs()` wired at vcgen.rs:325-326; both TDD tests GREEN | Phase 30 |
| 7 phases unverified (05, 06, 07, 08, 11, 13, 17) | **CLOSED** — VERIFICATION.md created for all 7; all PASS or PASS WITH NOTES | Phase 32 |

All 9 flows from the previous audit remain intact after Phases 30, 31, 32.

| Flow | Status | Notes |

| Z3 model → typed values → Ariadne/VSCode display | ✓ COMPLETE | cex_render.rs exported and called from parallel.rs |
| StdlibContractRegistry → VCGen inter-procedural | ✓ COMPLETE | load_default_contracts → merge_into → Arc<ContractDatabase> → generate_vcs_with_db |

| CoroutineInfo → state_invariant → CEX extraction → IDE | ✓ COMPLETE | async_vcgen::generate_async_vcs wired from vcgen.rs line 784 |
| bv2int eligibility → QF_LIA encoding → differential test | ✓ COMPLETE | uses_spec_int_types() at lines 1531-1572; set-logic ALL triggered at line 1595 |
| IteratorKind IR → AUFLIA/QF_LIA VCs | ✓ COMPLETE | for_loop_vcgen::generate_for_loop_vcs wired at vcgen.rs line 743 |

### Phase 14 — E2E Performance Benchmark (RESOLVED — Phase 33 Plan 01)

**Resolution:** E2E incremental performance tests pass with `#[ignore]` annotation removed. 20-30x speedup confirmed via E2E benchmark suite.

### Phase 18 — bv2int Documentation Format Decision (RESOLVED — Phase 33 Plan 02)

**Resolution:** `docs/bv2int.md` standalone reference document created. Product decision made: standalone doc file required and delivered.

## Workspace Test Health

```
cargo test --workspace: 3,154 passed | 0 failed | ~35 ignored (environment/deferred/by-design)
cargo test --doc -p rust-fv-analysis: 1 passed | 0 failed | 28 ignored (rust,ignore fences — correct)
